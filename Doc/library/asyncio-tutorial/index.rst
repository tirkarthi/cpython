Asyncio Tutorial
================

Programming with ``async def`` functions is differs from normal Python
functions; enough so that it is useful to explain a bit more
about what ``asyncio`` is for, and how to use it in typical
programs.

This tutorial will focus on what an end-user of ``asyncio`` should
learn to get the most value out of it. Our focus is going to be
primarily on the "high-level" API, as described in the
:mod:`documentation <asyncio>`.
